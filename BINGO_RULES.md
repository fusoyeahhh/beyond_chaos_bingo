# Beyond Chaos Bingo Rules

BC Bingo is a game centered around the Beyond Chaos randomizer that is heavily influenced by [gyre's](https://twitch/.tv/gyre) Final Fantasy Bingo, just structured differently. Because the game is so long, and the list of things you can see is so vast, the game is structured into 7 different segments --- each with a unique list of things that can generate on a bingo card.

General Rules:

 - You may not use save states.
 - You may not continue to the next segment until you have obtained a bingo for the segment you am currently in. If you do, it is an automatic run over by disqualification.
 - In Segment 6, once bingo is obtained, you must stop all side-questing and immediately begin Kefka's Tower.

## Segments

 - Segment 1 - Start of the Game through End of the Opera House
 - Segment 2 - Start of the Southern Continent through crashing the Airship
 - Segment 3 - Crashing the Airship through the End of the World
 - Segment 4 - Begining of the World of Ruin through the Falcon Takeoff
 - Segment 5 - Control of the Falcon through 6 Side-Quests (More on that below)
 - Segment 6 - End of the 6th Side-Quest through to Bingo
 - Segment 7 - Kefka's Tower through to End of the Game
