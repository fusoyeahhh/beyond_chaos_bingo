# Beyond Chaos Bingo Rules

BC Bingo is a game centered around the Beyond Chaos randomizer that is heavily influenced by [gyre's](https://twitch/.tv/gyre) Final Fantasy Bingo, just structured differently. Because the game is so long, and the list of things you can see is so vast, the game is structured into 7 different segments --- each with a unique list of things that can generate on a bingo card.

## General Rules

 1 You may not use save states.
 1 You may not continue to the next segment until you have obtained a bingo for the segment you am currently in. If you do, it is an automatic run over by disqualification.
 1 In Segment 6, once bingo is obtained, you must stop all side-questing and immediately begin Kefka's Tower.
 1 Conditions do not generally carry over between segments, e.g., violating conduct in segment 2 does not carry over to segment 3 and observing a certain enemy skill does not carry over another segment square with that skill.
   1 Exceptions include examples like: Possessing the requisite number of an item does qualify in either segment, e.g., having 99 Tonics in segment 1, then getting that square in segment 2 will automatically activate it in segment 2 if the player still has 99 Tonics.

## Segments

 - Segment 1 - Start of the Game through End of the Opera House
 - Segment 2 - Start of the Southern Continent through crashing the Airship
 - Segment 3 - Crashing the Airship through the End of the World
 - Segment 4 - Begining of the World of Ruin through the Falcon Takeoff
 - Segment 5 - Control of the Falcon through 6 Side-Quests (More on that below)
 - Segment 6 - End of the 6th Side-Quest through to Bingo
 - Segment 7 - Kefka's Tower through to End of the Game

The Side-Quests in the World of Ruin are as follows:
 - Mt. Zozo (Obtaining Cyan)

 - Cyan's Dream (Defeating Wrexsoul)
 - Phoenix Cave (Obtaining Locke/Phoenix)
 - Fanatics Tower (Defeating L.255 Magic)

## Squares

In general, the squares are divided into several "types":
 - `free`: one per segment, always appears somewhere, is always `Don't Game Over or Reset`
 - `Skills/Spells`: typically phrased as "Enemy Uses ..."
 - `Enemy Specials`:  typically phrased as "Get Hit by...", note that means that the attack must not produce the `miss` indicator in order to count
 - `Items/Resources`: typically phrased as "Have ...", you must have the indicated quantity at some point during the segment
 - `Equipment/Relics`: same as `Items/Resources`
 - `Task Completions`: once completed, is not "uncompleted" with a game over
 - `Conducts`: typically phrased as "Always ..." or "Never ...", conduct is broken (and the square is marked as blocked) if the condition is violated at any time during the segment, until then one is free to mark it as active from the beginning of the segment
 - `Boss Choices`: typically "Defeat ..." but also has some story related tasks such as "Trade Odin for Raiden"
 - `Boss Completions`: typically "Defeat ..."

Each card is generated by pulling from a pool of these squares on a per-segment basis, with the number of choices and the number chosen per type and segment (as of `v0.0.2`) as follows:

|   segment_index | type             |   choices |   count |
